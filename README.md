What Could Go Wrong 

*NOTE: We're still working on filling the knowledgebase this is an initial commit*

For small businesses the associated problem is that governance really isn’t their turf at all. Being an entrepreneur requires being agile and act ad-hoc by definition. It is the opposite of security governance, or at least so it seems. Once an entrepreneur might come to the conclusion that security does require some planning, she will run into a wall of complexity we, the security community, have carefully build up in the past decades. And so the SMB stops in it’s track towards improvement, carries on it’s insecure business and puts information security for ever in the complexity bin.
At Zolder we want to break through this deadlock. It’s been long enough by now that companies are still completely unaware of the issues that doom around the corner. It requires information of those issues to be understandable and attractive for consumption.

**So we decided to build and maintain a ‘What Could Go Wrong’ Knowledgebase. The main ingredients for setting this up**:
- Mapped to VERIS Framework — Actions & Varieties
- Attractive artwork to match every variety

We created a cyberpunk image library mapped to VERIS Framework.
VERIS is build and maintained by Verizon. They use it for their yearly Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR) and it allows them to normalize data they acquire from authorities around the world. There are more datamodels but VERIS from our perspective stands out in terms of completeness, clarity and most of all: proper maintenance (at least that’s what we hope ;)).

For the artwork we wanted to acquire a style that matches a heavily digitalized world. After all: they reason we want to break the deadlock is because in the coming decades digitalization is paramount and security should be considered with that in mind. Security should be more and more a topic to cover process automation, robotics, autonomous things, etc.

The relevant style to visualize such a world is the Cyberpunk artform. So we looked for a good artist to support our goal. And suddenly were pointed to Jhony Caballero, an illustrator from Bogotá, Colombia.
